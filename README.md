# Unity Editor Tools

A small collection of Unity editor tools I created to learn editor scripting.

## Contents

### Missing Script Finder
Finds all GameObjects in the scene with missing scripts.

### Prefab Spawner
Spawns a selected prefab to one of four random spawn points.

### Level Exporter
Exports all GameObjects with a specific tag into a JSON file.
