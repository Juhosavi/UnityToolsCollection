# Unity Editor Tools

A small collection of Unity editor tools I created to learn editor scripting and support my Metacore internship application.

## Contents

### 1. Missing Script Finder
Finds all GameObjects in the scene with missing scripts.

- Access from: `Tools > Find Missing Scripts`
- Logs results to the console

### 2. Prefab Spawner
Spawns a selected prefab to one of four random spawn points.

- Select a prefab in the editor
- Access from: `Tools > Prefab Spawner`
- Click to spawn!

### 3. Simple Player Movement
Very basic movement script for testing purposes.

- Move with arrow keys or WASD
- Add the script to any GameObject

### 4. Level Exporter
Exports all GameObjects with a specific tag into a JSON file.

- Captures position and rotation data
- JSON is saved to: `Assets/ExportedData/`
- Access from: `Tools > Level Exporter`

## How to Use

1. Drop the folder into your Unity project under `Assets/`
2. Open Unity
3. Find all tools in the top menu under `Tools`
