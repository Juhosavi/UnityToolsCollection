# Unity Editor Tools

A small collection of Unity editor tools I created to learn editor scripting and support my Metacore internship application.

## Contents

### Missing Script Finder
Finds all GameObjects in the scene with missing scripts.

- Access from: `Tools > Find Missing Scripts`
- Logs results to the console

### Prefab Spawner
Spawns a selected prefab to one of four random spawn points.

- Select a prefab in the editor
- Access from: `Tools > Prefab Spawner`
- Click to spawn!


### Level Exporter
Exports all GameObjects with a specific tag into a JSON file.

- Captures position and rotation data
- JSON is saved to: `Assets/ExportedData/`
- Access from: `Tools > Level Exporter`
